# Comments to Evaluators:

The "ClientGUI" project will create the players "view" (i.e., the GUI) 
for the game and process the players Controls. 

There will be two main screens: 
(1) Welcome screen where the player gives their name and the host to connect to, 
(2) the game screen (including the playing world and game over screen).

All of the codes are created based on the suggestions and requirements in the
Assignment 8 Google Doc document.

We wrote all of this code from scratch and did not copy it in part or whole from another source.
