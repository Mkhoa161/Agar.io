# Comments to Evaluators:

This project represents the game logic for Agario which is used by both client
code and server code. In other words, this project contains classes constructing
some basic elements such as GameObject (Food, Player...) or World class.

All of the codes are created based on the suggestions and requirements in the
Assignment 8 Google Doc document.

We wrote all of this code from scratch and did not copy it in part or whole from another source.
