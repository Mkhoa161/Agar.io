# Comments to Evaluators:

This file acts as a Networking class provided by Professor Jim de St. Germain for the Assignment 8.
This file will be in the replace of our own Communications class from the previous assignment, so we
want to make sure that our starting step is correct due to the unreleased grades from Assignment 8.
